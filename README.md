# LLM-for-Mental-Health-Research

A curated paper list of mental health research using large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

## Methods for Suicide Risk Assessment and Detection

<!-- ### As an Information/Feature Provider, Data Generator, and Analyzer

LLMs can serve as knowledge providers, expert systems, and data generators for suicide risk assessment and research.

### LLM as an Agent

LLMs as agents with access to external tools like clinical databases, risk assessment frameworks, etc.

- [Measuring delusional ideation: the 21-item Peters et al. Delusions Inventory (PDI)](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article-abstract/30/4/1005/1930847)

- [Measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/13/2/261/1919795)


<!-- ### As a Decision Maker/Explainer

LLMs directly making assessments or providing explanations for suicide risk factors.
