# LLM-for-Mental-Health-Research

A curated paper list of mental health research using large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

## Methods for Suicide Risk Assessment and Detection



### LLM as an Agent

LLMs as agents with access to external tools like clinical databases, risk assessment frameworks, etc.
